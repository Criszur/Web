  <p>Hello, this is a little description about me and why I'm taking this microdencial: I'm currently a professional, 
majoring in Business, I'm from Ecuador and all my career was focused in Business 
but I knew the technology always was something I wished to learn, Iâ€™m very curious and I am enjoy 
learning a new career, this is a new field and it is incredible because now I have the opportunity to reach a 
better future, I plan to study and dedicate the most 
time possible, this is going to be little hard but I know for sure is the future, and I 
know worth it.  Thank you and have a great one!!!</p>
